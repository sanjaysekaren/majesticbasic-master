    "reviewAndFeedback":"'The book is about finding out what is truly important to your real spiritual self rather than being inundated with material possessions.” Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) 'A captivating story that teaches as it delights.' Paulo Coelho '[Its] principles have been fascinating and there were shared principles from writers such as Robin Sharma and Deepak Chopra. How does all that impact on a game of rugby?
